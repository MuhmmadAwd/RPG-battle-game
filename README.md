This RPG battle game allows players to control a wizard character and fight
against different monsters. The wizard and monsters are represented by character
cards that display their name, avatar, health, and dice rolls. Each character
has a different number of dice rolls and takes turns attacking the other
character. The game continues until either the wizard or all the monsters are
defeated.
